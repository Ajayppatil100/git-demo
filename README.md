Hello, and welcome to Git!
Congratulations on cloning your (possibly) first repository!
As tempting as it is to leave this file with a 'Hello World', for once we may settle with something slightly more useful.

This potentially dummy file shall now serve as a reminder of the instructions you need to execute!

---- FORKING AND ADDING YOUR FORK TO THE REPO ----
Step 1: Fork dat repo to your own account.
Step 2: Enter the following command to link this repo to your fork! The syntax is: git remote add <whatever you wanna call this link> <URL to that repo>
E.g. git remote add mine https://https://github.com/username/jigglywiggly.git

---- CREATING A NEW BRANCH BEFORE YOU MAKE MODIFICATIONS ----
Step 3: git checkout -b <new branch name> // remember, the -b flag means create a new branch

---- ADDING YOUR UNDENIABLY AWESOME CHANGES ----
Step 4: <Make the changes to this repo this world so desperately needs>
Step 5: Take a look at your uncommitted changes with 'git status'
The ones in red are "unstaged" while the ones in green are "staged"
Step 6: git add -A // (means add all changed files to the staging area)
Step 7: git commit -m <message of your choice> // the changes in the staging are committed

---- PUSHING YOUR CHANGES (COMMIT) TO GIT ----
Step 8: git push mine <name of the new branch you had created>

---- REQUESTING TO MERGE YOUR CHANGES WITH THE MAIN REPO (ORIGIN) ----
Step 9: Go to your repo page. Navigate to your branch. Click on whatever sounds like "Make Pull Request"
Step 10: Wait with bated breath for your change to be accepted
