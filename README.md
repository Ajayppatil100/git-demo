<h1>Hello, and welcome to Git!</h1>
Congratulations on cloning your (possibly) first repository!<br>
As tempting as it is to leave this file with a 'Hello World', for once we may settle with something slightly more useful.
<br><br>
This file has been rescued from being the embodiment of a programming cliche, and shall now serve as a reminder of the instructions you need to execute.
<h3>FORKING AND ADDING YOUR FORK TO THE REPO</h3>
Step 1: Fork dat repo to your own account.<br>
Step 2: Enter the following command to link this repo to your fork! The syntax is: git remote add [whatever you wanna call this link] [URL to that repo]<br>
E.g. git remote add mine https://https://github.com/username/jigglywiggly.git
<h3>CREATING A NEW BRANCH BEFORE YOU MAKE MODIFICATIONS</h3>
Step 3: git checkout -b [new branch name] // remember, the -b flag means create a new branch<br>
<h3>ADDING YOUR UNDENIABLY AWESOME CHANGES</h3>
Step 4: Make the changes to this repo this world so desperately needs<br>
Step 5: Take a look at your uncommitted changes with 'git status'<br>
The ones in red are "unstaged" while the ones in green are "staged"<br>
Step 6: git add -A // (means add all changed files to the staging area)<br>
Step 7: git commit -m [message of your choice] // the changes in the staging are committed<br>
<h3>PUSHING YOUR CHANGES (COMMIT) TO GIT</h3>
Step 8: git push mine [name of the new branch you had created]<br>
<h3>REQUESTING TO MERGE YOUR CHANGES WITH THE MAIN REPO (ORIGIN)</h3>
Step 9: Go to your repo page. Navigate to your branch. Click on whatever sounds like "Make Pull Request"<br>
Step 10: Wait with bated breath for your change to be accepted<br>
